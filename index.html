                        In 2007 I began my studies in journalism at Northern Illinois University. I loved writing. I loved creating.
                         I was interested in telling stories in a way that would offer an interesting look at the human experience. The school had a 
                         daily newspaper, so I applied to become a columnist.

                         I entered a daily newspaper production as the industry was exiting the print and transitioning
                         to the digital age. Learning all the Adobe &copy; software to design and edit content peaked my
                         interest in the power of computers. Along with the creative software, it was our job as editors to
                         manage content online, which first introduced me to a CMS.

                        After several years of terrible sales and data entry jobs, I finally landed a job with 
                        the skills I developed in school and at the newspaper. I became a content creator. I 
                        wrote content, shot and edited video and photo, designed digital displays, and more. I
                        became a digital communications generalist. All the contnet I created I had to manage online as well.
                        This was part-time, though, so I needed more.

                            The transition from SWIC to WashU was an obvious one. The Career Center needed somebody with my exact skills to
                            create marketing content and manage their website's content. We recently moved our site from Sharepoint (yuck) to
                            Wordpress. I quickly learned how much I did not know about coding and how much those who did were paid. HI!

                            I work in WashU's Career Center. I send out the marketing for jobs, events, etc. If I've learned anything,
                            it's that computers skills are the most in-demand skills outside of medicine. From simply working with data 
                            to designing apps, coding seemed like the most logical way to supplment my digital storytelling skills in a 
                            meaningful way. I'm hoping I can create platforms for more digital storytellers to create content.
